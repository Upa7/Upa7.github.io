        <h2>What do you need?</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 1/3 cups sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>sprinkles, for coating (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h3> Instructions: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. </li>
                <li>Beat the butter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar and continue beating until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add 
                    the eggs one at a time, beating between each addition, then add the vanilla.</li>
                <li>Add the flour and then beat just until combined.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough in half then shape each piece of dough into a log. Wrap each dough log securely in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for
                    a minimum of 1 hour. </li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the fridge, then roll each log in sprinkles (optional).</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Working with one log at a time, slice the log into 1/4-inch rounds. Arrange the
                    cookies on the baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart. Freeze the cookies for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes until set. Once done baking, place them on cooling rack.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Notes & Tips:</h2>
            <p> Here are some things to consider when you are baking these cookies...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not let the cookies get golden brown when baking!</li>
                <li>The cookie dough can be frozen up to 2 months.</li>
                <li>After your cookies are baked, make sure to store them in airtight container.</li>
                <li>When mixing your ingredients, avoid over mixing. This can cause your cookies to be dense and not taste as good.</li>
            </ul>
