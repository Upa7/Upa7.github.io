            <p> I personally love traveling, and being outside in nature always helps me feel calm. Whenever I am stressed, I like to go out for a walk or just sit outside and 
                take everything in. There is a quiet kind of peace I get from nature that I can not find just sitting at home. I have visited places like Taj Mahal, Grand Canyon, 
                California, Italy, Paris, India, Virginia, New Hampshire, Vermont, etc. I am really hoping to visit Switzerland, Greenland, and Spain soon. </p>
