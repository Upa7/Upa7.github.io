        <h2> Welcome to my website!</h2>
        <p> Hi, my name is Upashana Suresh Kumar and I am currently a student at UMass Amherst studying both Data Science and Resource Economics. 
        My background in Informatics along with hands on experience in data collection and website management, allows me to bridge the gap between data driven insights 
        and user engagement. As a FIERCE mentor and robotics instructor at Massenberg, I have developed skills in leadership, problem solving, data collection, and 
        outreach. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can innovate and be a impactful member of a team. </p>

        <h2> More about me...</h2>
        <p> In my free time, I love getting creative with baking, a hobby I really got into during the pandemic. Trying out new recipes and experimenting with decorations 
            became my way of having fun and making something unique. When I am not baking, I love being outdoors, whether it is hiking, rock climbing, or
            just sitting outside and journaling. There is something about reaching the top of a trail or just being in nature that feels refreshing. Besides my hobbies, 
            I also enjoy working on personal projects, whether it is diving into Data Science, exploring Cybersecurity, or designing something cool. </p>

        <p> My motivation for choosing Data Science as my career path comes from my interest in data collection and coding. Back in high school, I initially thought 
            I would pursue a career in Biomedical Sciences, but I soon realized I wanted more creative freedom, something that would let me innovate and think outside the box. 
            That is what drew me to coding. I love how even a small change in syntax can lead to completely different outcomes, and there is never just one right answer. 
            The possibilities are endless, which makes it both challenging and exciting.</p>
